# Project Title
Konnect

## Overview

Say hi to Konnect, the innovative networking app that fosters genuine connections through simple clicks. Say no more to superficial interactions, Konnect prioritizes meaningful and authentic connections, by matching individuals based on shared interests. Say goodbye to awkward interactions, hello to lifelong connections.

### Problem

The need to belong and fit in is more crucial than ever. With the rise of technology and social media, coupled with global events like the COVID pandemic and modern work lifestyles, people are experiencing higher loneliness than ever. The Meta-Gallup survey found that 1 in 4 adults worldwide has reported feeling lonely. While, there are applications like Bumble BFF, Linkedin and MeetUp, it's often challenging to establish lasting friendships with individuals who have different interests and can feel inauthentic. There are also "hubs" like Monday Girl and activity clubs, such as sports leagues, where you can meet others. However, these opportunities often entail upfront costs to join. 

### User Profile

In the first iteration of my application, my target audience are Gen Z and Millenial users:
    - looking to meet people in their current location 
    - looking to meet individuals with similar interests and bond over participating in these activities
    - participate in new activites they have been meaning to try with others

### Features 

- Important Mentions: 
    - Authentication is not a priority for this iteration, however JWT tokens are used to ensure that user credentials are correct to pull server data that matches user credentials on database side (password not encrypted currently)
    - Message tab is future focus, however high level UI design is shown

- Login to my account
- Register for an account
- View current account profile/details 
- Logout of my account

- View events that I am hosting
- View events that I am going to or have pending status to join event
- Create New Event
- View specific event details that I am attending/pending/hosting:
    - If I am the host, I would like to know:
        - What are the event details
        - Which guests are going and viewing their details
        - Which guests do I still need to approve/reject and whether I am compatible with them
    - If I am a guest, I would like to know:
        - What are the event details
        - Which other guests are going and viewing their details
        - If I have not been accepted yet and can longer attend, I would like to cancel the request to join

- Explore new events and see details
- View event host user details
- State whether I am uninterested or interested in joining the event
